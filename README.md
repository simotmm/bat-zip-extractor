# bat zip extractor
simple bat script to extract all zip files in a folder.
## steps
- step 1: place the `extract_all.bat` file in the folder that contains the zip archives.
- step 2: run the `extract_all.bat` file.
- step 3: enjoy your extracted folders.

(for large number of zip files you can try the parallel version `parallel_bat_zip_extractor.bat` that's inside the `parallel` folder).
